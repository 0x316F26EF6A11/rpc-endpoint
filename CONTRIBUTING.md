# Contributing guide

Welcome to the Flashbots collective! We just ask you to be nice when you play with us.

The server is made up of a few components:

- `server.go`: the main server code where json rpc requests are validated and handled
- `request.go`: handles one specific user request
- `types.go`: defines json rpc types
- `util.go`: contains utility functions

## Send a pull request

- Your proposed changes should be first described and discussed in an issue.
- Every pull request should be small and represent a single change. If the problem is complicated, split it in multiple issues and pull requests.
- Every pull request should be covered by unit tests.

We appreciate your contributions <3
