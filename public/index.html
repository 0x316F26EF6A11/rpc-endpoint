    <h2 id="flashbots-rpc-endpoint">Flashbots RPC Endpoint</h2>
    <p><strong>Please note that the Flashbots RPC endpoint is currently in beta. Your transactions may occasionally not be mined!</strong></p>
    <p>The Flashbots RPC Endpoint allows regular users to easily submit their transactions to the Flashbots Auction by using a custom RPC endpoint in their wallet. Everything should be the same for users, except transactions are sent to Flashbots, and then directly to miners, instead of the public mempool.</p>
    <p>There are a few key benefits to using the Flashbots RPC endpoint:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frontrunning protection:</strong> your transaction will not be seen by hungry sandwich bots in the public mempool.</li>
        <li><strong>No failed transactions:</strong> your transaction will only be mined if it doesn&#39;t include any reverts, so you don&#39;t pay for failed transactions. Note: your transaction could be uncled, emitted to the mempool, and then included on-chain.</li>
        <li><strong>Priority in blocks:</strong> transactions sent via Flashbots are mined at the top of blocks, giving them priority.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="key-considerations">Key considerations</h2>
    <p>Before you get started here are a few things to be mindful of</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high gas price!!</strong> Getting included in a block through Flashbots is harder than getting included in a block normally because you’re competing with MEV bots for priority blockspace in an auction. To maximize your chance of getting included use a high gas price.</li>
        <li><strong>Your transactions will not display on Etherscan unless and until they are mined.</strong> This is because Etherscan will not be able to see your transaction in the public mempool, and as such doesn&#39;t know that it exists. We are working on ways for users to query the status of their transactions.</li>
        <li>We will try to resubmit your transaction for 25 blocks after which point it is considered “expired” and will be dropped.</li>
        <li>Transactions under 42,000 gas, such as simple ether transfers, are rejected by the Flashbots relay. As a result, we will forward these to the public mempool instead.</li>
        <li>Transactions that perform simple actions - such as token approvals or transfers - will be sent to the public mempool as these do not need frontrunning protection.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="how-to-use-the-flashbots-rpc-endpoint-in-metamask">How to use the Flashbots RPC Endpoint in MetaMask</h2>
    <p>To add the Flashbots endpoint follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click your RPC endpoint at the top of your MetaMask. By default it says “Ethereum mainnet.”</li>
        <li>Click “Custom RPC”</li>
        <li>Add <code>https://rpc.flashbots.net</code> with a chainID of <code>1</code> and currency of <code>ETH</code>.</li>
        <li>Scroll to the bottom and click “Save”</li>
    </ol>
